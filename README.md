# ODE_system
Small ODE system of an eye to play around
Additionally: Some python packages and uses thereof
to open .sbml files and run simulations

Packages considered: Tellurium, SBMLtoODE, libRoadRunner

change files in var.py according to desired file location before running
change booleans and method in main.py before running and import desired plotting regime
Plotting regimes need to be adapted to your specific model, this can be done in the respective plotfile.py
